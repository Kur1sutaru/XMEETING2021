## MAGICAL RULES ü¶Ñ üßÅ üñ•Ô∏è

Xpress presentation
Published: 27 April 2021
There are two separate things you have to prepare in order to submit your Xpress presentation: 1st: Your Abstract; 2nd: Your video/audio presentation. Remember that, the video upload should be done after your abstract and conference registration. On this page you will gather information on how to accomplish both productions.

 

Instructions for Abstract Submission:

A maximum of two submissions is allowed per presenting author.
Abstracts must be in English.
Abstracts must have between 250 and 500 words.
Abstracts must describe scientific data.
A brief description of preliminary results in the abstract is encouraged.
All authors' names, e-mails and institutions must be declared in the proper fields.
If all authors belong to the same institution, its name must be declared only once. 
Submit your poster to one of the areas below.
 

Please, DO NOT:

Do not include names, e-mails, institutions and funding agencies in the abstract field.
Do not include figures, tables or references in the abstract.
Do not divide your abstract in sections.
Do not include acknowledgements to individuals or funding agencies in the abstract. There is a specific field for funding information.
Do not include advertisement material.
Areas:

- Omics

Subjects: Genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics. Processing, integration, and data analysis from different sequencing technologies. Gene and protein characterization and annotations.

- Structural Bioinformatics

Subjects: Experimental or In silico Molecular modeling of biomolecules and supramolecular complexes. Molecular dynamics simulation. Molecular docking and virtual screening studies. QSAR. Immunoinformatics. Quantum biochemistry. RNA structure and function.

- Systems Biology and Modeling

Subjects: Analysis of Biological Networks. Graph's theory application. Computational modeling of biological systems. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning using biological/health data. Data science. Epidemiological modeling and transmission dynamics.

- Database and Software Development

Subjects: Development of computational tools, application, and algorithms. Biological databases. Database integration.

- Phylogeny and Evolution

Subjects: Molecular Phylogenetics. Phylodynamics analysis. Evolutionary analyses of genes and proteins. Population genetics. Molecular Evolution. Coalescence studies. 

- Education

Subjects: Educational applications of Bioinformatics and computational biology. Methods for developing biological data analysis skills. Development of Educational tools. Example cases of educational methodologies applied to bioinformatics learning.

 

Presentation

All posters will be presented as short videos (up to 5 minutes long). We strongly suggest that you submit your work in English, but this is not mandatory. For the comfort of presenters and audiences, poster presentations will be distributed over two days, 27/10 and 28/10, in which participants will have the opportunity to discuss the posters in exclusive chat rooms. The poster numbers will be informed after the poster acceptance deadline. If you cannot present yourself on a specific date, please inform the poster coordinator by email (xmeeting.poster@ab3c.org.br).
